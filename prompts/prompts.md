Help me build a generic Agentic AI solution based on Publish Subscribe (pub/sub) based architecture using Redis.  The architecture should fit most Agentic AI use cases.  Make sure the architecture has Governance for agents and tools along with following capabilities:

1: State Management: Use the Redis Hash more effectively. The orchestrator or an "Aggregator Agent" can listen on the results channel and update this hash as sub-tasks complete. This allows for complex workflows where you wait for multiple results before starting the next step.

2: Use Redis Streams instead of Pub/Sub for Tasks: Redis Pub/Sub is "fire-and-forget." If an agent is down when a message is published, it misses it. For mission-critical tasks, Redis Streams are a better choice. They act like a persistent log. Agents can read from the stream, acknowledge messages (with consumer groups), and you can guarantee that every task is processed.

3: Add More Agents: Each Agent subscribes to its own tool:* channel.

4: Sophisticated Planner: PlannerAgent with a real LLM call (e.g., using OpenAI's API with a prompt that asks it to create a JSON-based plan).

5: Error Handling: What happens if a tool fails? The agent should publish to a results:error channel. The orchestrator or planner can then decide to retry or try a different approach.
Agent Discovery & Scaling: For a truly large-scale system, you'd have a mechanism for agents to register their capabilities (e.g., in a Redis Set) and a way to run multiple copies of the same agent (e.g., 5 WebSearchAgents) that all pull tasks from the same channel/stream, distributing the load automatically.
